HTML - Hyper Text Mark Up Language
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    is used to write a document that can be shared across HTTP protocol.

    Hyper Text (Hyper Media) is a collection of plain text, formated text, graphcis and links.
    
    Mark up is a practise used in literature...

        WWW (World wide web) is quite ancient now.

        "This is your first day. Have a blast" said my manager.

        Vizag - the steel city - is my home town.

    The symbols used to mark up are called HTML elements.

    Each html element is made up of a opening tag + content + closing tag.

        <p> This is a para element and para content goes here </p>

    a sample html document

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <!-- meta data about the current page -->
            </head>
            <body>
                <!-- the page content -->
            </body>
        </html>
